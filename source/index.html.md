# Overview

## Introduction

**Welcome to HashKey Exchange API Documentation!**

HashKey Exchange offers a comprehensive suite of APIs including FIX, REST and Websocket API tailored to cater the needs of institutional-grade clients. Our Exchange API solutions are highly scalable, providing clients with access to real-time market data feeds and insights. Client can easily integrate our Exchange API with their existing systems and applications, enabling them to streamline their workflows.

Exchange offers three types of API Connectivity methods

### RestAPI

Our REST API offers a simple and secure way to manage orders and monitor your digital asset portfolios. The REST API can be publicly access endpoints via market data endpoints and private authenticated endpoints for trading, funding and account data which require requests to be signed.

### Websocket

Use an asynchronous method (pub/sub) approach to efficiently deliver push notifications for orders, transactions, market and other pertinent information. By subscribing to specific topics of interest, users can receive real-time updates without the need for constant polling.

### FIX Protocol (Current available to our Omnibus institutional clients)

HashKey Exchange FIX connection is an industry-standard solution for our institutional clients to take advantage of our high availability system. It is specifically engineered to handle large amount of throughput supporting end-to-end order entry, order management and access to our rich liquidity feeds.
